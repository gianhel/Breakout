## Suggested tasks

* Implement mouse input for pad
* Improved VFX (ball trail, paddle hit response, brick particle destruction)
* Better UI (progress bar rather than timer for countdown).
* GameLoop
* Better ball physics (Box2D)
* Leaderboards
* More ball types (e.g., multiball, sticky ball [where you shoot the ball from the paddle every time], tiny ball, big ball, brick-trackingÂ ball)
